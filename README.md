# ✈️ AI-Driven Airline Operations & Predictive Flight Management Automation System

(**AI-Driven_AO&PFMAS**)

## 📌 Overview

AI-Driven_AO&PFMAS is a Python-based simulation of a real-world airline operations control system. This project was developed as part of an internship to demonstrate how airlines automate operational monitoring, risk detection, and decision support using structured data and rule-based logic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Monitor aircraft health using operational logs
* Predict flight delays due to weather, maintenance, and congestion
* Optimize crew scheduling and detect shortages
* Analyze passenger load and demand trends
* Generate alerts, dashboards, and daily reports

---

## 🔄 System Flow (High Level)

1. Ingest airline input data (aircraft, weather, crew, passengers)
2. Process and structure raw logs
3. Monitor aircraft health and generate alerts
4. Predict potential flight delays
5. Validate crew availability and schedules
6. Analyze passenger load and demand
7. Display operational dashboard
8. Generate daily aviation report
